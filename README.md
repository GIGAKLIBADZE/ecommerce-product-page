## My process

I split the project into different components, pages and layout and initialized each of them. Configure React router. For styling, I used Styled-components. I built the project with TypeScript.

### Built with

Semantic HTML5 markup
Mobile-first workflow
TypeScript
React JS
Styled Components
React Router

### What I learned

After already creating some advanced level projects in React JS, I can confidently say that I am now familiar with some advanced concepts of this library. I build a project using React Router for the second time in my React journey. In this project I introduce some brand new hook useContext which helped me in providing useStates easily. I have also deepened my knowledge TypeScript. I plan to continue working on projects involving React and TypeScript to further enhance my understanding.

### Continued development

Already, after building some of React JS projects, I am going to commence learning in it..
